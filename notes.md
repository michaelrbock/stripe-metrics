Notes on Stripe API DX:

* When I select a language on a docs page, e.g. Python, it should update *all*
the examples, not just the example below the language selection so that I don't
have to re-select Python multiple times.
* To someone unfamilar with Stripe, names like "Connect" and "Sigma" don't
easily tell me where to look in the docs.
* There seem to be two versions of the docs, a one at https://stripe.com/docs/api
and one at https://stripe.com/docs and I wasn't sure which
to use when.
* Love the "Was this section Helpful (Yes/No)" questions.
